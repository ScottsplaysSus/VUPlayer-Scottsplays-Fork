Overview
--------
VUPlayer is an open-source multi-format audio player for Windows 7 SP1 or later.
MusicBrainz functionality requires an internet connection.
Audioscrobbler functionality requires an internet connection and a Last.fm account.


Command-line
------------
Ordinarily, VUPlayer stores application settings and metadata in a SQLite database in the user documents folder.
To run in 'portable' mode, leaving no database footprint, the application can be launched using the following command-line argument(s):

	VUPlayer.exe -portable [settings file]

The optional [settings file] parameter specifies the location of an application settings file to use.
The 'Export Settings' function in the main application can be used to save the current settings in the correct format.
Please note that MusicBrainz & Audioscrobbler functionality is disabled when running in 'portable' mode.
